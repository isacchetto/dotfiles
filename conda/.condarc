# # channels (sequence: primitive)
# #   aliases: channel
# #   env var string delimiter: ','
# #   The list of conda channels to include for relevant operations.
# # 
channels:
  - defaults
  - conda-forge
  - bioconda

# # channel_priority (ChannelPriority)
# #   Accepts values of 'strict', 'flexible', and 'disabled'. The default
# #   value is 'flexible'. With strict channel priority, packages in lower
# #   priority channels are not considered if a package with the same name
# #   appears in a higher priority channel. With flexible channel priority,
# #   the solver may reach into lower priority channels to fulfill
# #   dependencies, rather than raising an unsatisfiable error. With channel
# #   priority disabled, package version takes precedence, and the
# #   configured priority of channels is used only to break ties. In
# #   previous versions of conda, this parameter was configured as either
# #   True or False. True is now an alias to 'flexible'.
# # 
channel_priority: flexible
# channel_priority: strict

# # auto_update_conda (bool)
# #   Auto Update Conda any time a user updates 
# #   or installs a package in the root environment
# #
auto_update_conda: True

# # update_dependencies (bool)
# #   When True, automatically update dependencies when installing packages that
# #   require a newer version of a dependency than is currently installed.
# #
update_dependencies: True

# # auto_activate_base (bool)
# #   Automatically activate the base environment during shell
# #   initialization (eval "$($CONDA_EXE shell.posix activate)")
# # 
auto_activate_base: False

# # auto_stack (int)
# #   Implicitly use --stack when using activate if current level of nesting
# #   (as indicated by CONDA_SHLVL environment variable) is less than or
# #   equal to specified value. 0 or false disables automatic stacking, 1 or
# #   true enables it for one level.
# # 
auto_stack: 1

# # default_threads (int)
# #   Threads to use by default for parallel operations. Default is None,
# #   which allows operations to choose themselves. This value affects:
# #   * repodata_threads - for fetching/loading repodata
# #   * verify_threads - for verifying package contents in transactions
# #   * execute_threads - for carrying out the unlinking and linking steps
# # 
default_threads: 4

# # fetch_threads (int)
# #   Threads to use when downloading packages. When not set, defaults to None,
# #   which uses the default ThreadPoolExecutor behavior.
# # 
fetch_threads: 4

# # anaconda_anon_usage (bool)
# #   When True, conda will report anonymous usage data to Anaconda, Inc.
# #
anaconda_anon_usage: False
